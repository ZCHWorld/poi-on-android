[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/centic9/poi-on-android.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/centic9/poi-on-android) [![Gradle Status](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/centic9/poi-on-android/status.svg?branch=master)](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/centic9/poi-on-android/status)

This is a sample Android application to show how
Apache POI can be used on Android.

It consists of two projects:
* poishadow: A small helper project to produce
  a shaded jar-file for Apache POI which includes
  all necessary dependencies and fixes a few things
  that usually hinder you deploying Apache POI on
  Android
* poitest: A very small sample Android application
  which performs some actions on an XLSX-file using
  Apache POI. See `DocumentListActivity` for the actual
  code

#### Getting started

##### Necessary System-Properties

In order to work around problems with finding a suitable XML Parser, currently
the following system properties need to be set manually during startup of your
application (let me know if you know of a better way to do this, see issue #10)

    System.setProperty("org.apache.poi.javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory", "com.fasterxml.aalto.stax.InputFactoryImpl");
    System.setProperty("org.apache.poi.javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory", "com.fasterxml.aalto.stax.OutputFactoryImpl");
    System.setProperty("org.apache.poi.javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory", "com.fasterxml.aalto.stax.EventFactoryImpl");

##### Supported Android versions

The sample project uses API level 15, which maps to Android 4.0.3. Theoretically lower versions should work 
as well, but we do not test these to avoid this additional effort.

##### Dependencies

Note: The dependencies of Apache POI are not included in the shading to keep it's size at bay. If you use code
areas which require commons-codec, commons-collections4 or any of the other dependencies, you will need to define
them in your Android application in addition to the poishadow-all.jar file dependency.

##### Use a pre-built jar

If you want to get started quickly, there is a ready-made jar-file available in the 
[release section](https://github.com/centic9/poi-on-android/releases). 

You should be able to simply add this to your Android project and use the Apache POI
classes from it.

##### Build the jar yourself

If you would like to change how the jar-file is built, e.g. if you need classes that
are excluded, use a different version of POI or would like to adjust the build in some
other way, you can build the shaded jar with the following steps:

Preparation:

You will need the following pieces in order to get started

* A recent Java SDK, preferably Java 8
* An installation of the Android SDK, either the one included
  with Android Studio or a separate download, see
  https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads

Get the code:

    git clone git://github.com/centic9/poi-on-android
    cd poi-on-android

Configure where your Android SDK resides:

    echo "sdk.dir=/opt/android-sdk-linux" > local.properties

Configure the version of the Android Build Tools that you have installed.

    vi poitest/build.gradle

Finally run the build and some testing. Make sure you have a device connected, e.g. the Android emulator.

    ./gradlew build connectedCheck

For only the jar-files run just `build`

#### Run the Android emulator

List available emulators

    <android-sdk>/tools/emulator -list-avds

Start an Android emulator

    <android-sdk>/tools/emulator -avd <name>

Install the apk

    <android-sdk>/platform-tools/adb install ./poitest/build/outputs/apk/poitest-debug.apk

#### Notes

* You can use the resulting jar-file `poishadow/build/libs/poishadow-all.jar`
  in your own project, the code in directory `poitest` is
  just a small sample Android application to show that it works.
* This was only tested in Android Studio with the Android
  emulator until now, should work on real Android as well, though!
* Tested with `targetSdkVersion 25` and `minSdkVersion 15`,
  although other versions should work as long as they support
  `multiDexEnabled true`

#### Todo

* Add more actual functionality to the sample application,
  currently it just creates a new spreadsheet, adds some data
  then stores it in the Application storage area and reads it
  again from there.
